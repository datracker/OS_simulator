Version: 4.0 (Full and Final)
/*Developed and tested in MacOSX Sierra*/

Important:
THE OUTPUTS ARE NOT ORDERED FOR THIS. BECAUSE, ALL THE I/O ARE WORKING INDEPENDENTLY AND 
LOGGING IN THEIR ACITVITY INDEPENDETLY. THIS IS HOW I IMPLEMENTED ASYNCHRONOUS MULTI-THREADING.
IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE OUTPUT IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER, THEN IT'S ALSO PROSSIBLE TO SHOW EASILY.
I IMPLEMENTED ASYNCHRONOUS MULTI-THREADING, BECAUSE THIS REPRESENTS REAL MULTI-THREADING
AS ALL THE THREADS ARE WORKING INDEPENDTLY AND NOT BOUND TO THE MAIN PROCESS.
PLEASE, LET ME KNOW IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE OUTPUT OTHERWISE. 

Instructions:

Go to the directory.
Type make clean in the terminal, and enter. This will clean the previous object file.
Type make and enter, this will create a new object file.
Type ./Sim03 <configuration_file>

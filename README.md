This is a very basic Operating system simulator made for the Operating System class at Unversity of Nevada, Reno.
Please read the "assignment_description.pdf" file to understand the functionality of this simulator.
You are most welcomed to use the code for your project, please acknowledge.
I appreciate all suggestions.
Thanks, enjoy.
